# Used libraries :
- tkinter
- requests
- pillow
- webbrowser

# Libraries Explaination :
- tkinter : The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit.
Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, including macOS, as well as on Windows systems.

- requests : Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add
query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your PUT & POST data — but nowadays, just use the json method!

- Pillow : The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.
This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly 
powerful image processing capabilities. The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few 
basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing tool.

- webbrowser : The webbrowser module provides a high-level interface to allow displaying web-based documents to users. 
Under most circumstances, simply calling the open() function from this module will do the right thing. Under Unix, graphical 
browsers are preferred under X11, but text-mode browsers will be used if graphical browsers are not available or an X11 display isn’t available. 
If text-mode browsers are used, the calling process will block until the user exits the browser.
